# Chat

This is an umbrella app combining a Phoenix web app with the ChatServer
app (https://github.com/ragegage/chat_server) and basic authentication.

To run locally: 

+ `git clone`
+ `cd chat_umbrella`
+ `mix phoenix.server`
+ Navigate to localhost:4000 and sign up to access the chat service

Instructions for creating a basic version of this app (the version on the 
`no-auth` branch) can be found at
https://github.com/ragegage/elixir_lectures/blob/master/phoenix_umbrella.md.
